# New Features and improvements
### Poetry Filter
Our group added a new filter to the ancient graffiti bibliography's sidebar. At the top level, a checkbox can be selected, leaving the user with a list of all poetry from the database. We also created a
structure for more specific poetry searching. If you expand the "All Poetry" checkbox, the user will be able to see three lower-level options, "Literary Quotation," "Popular Poetry," and "Meter." Although this
functionality has not been implemented, in theory, these checkboxes should work as follows.

##### Literary Quotation
The literary quotation checkbox allows the user to filter for all poetic graffiti that is quoting or referencing a well known author. The user can expand this checkbox as well, and they will be able to see
a list of 7 authors that are frequently found in the AGP database. 

##### Popular Poetry
The popular poetry checkbox allows users to view a list of all poetic scriptures that reference well-known works. The user can expand the checkbox to see a few examples of the most commonly referenced works
in the database

##### Meter
The meter checkbox allows the user to filter for all poetry in the database with a defined meter. Expanding the textbox, the user can search for one of the seven specified meter types in the database. 


### New Datbase Information
Our group read a CSV contianing information about poetic graffiti into a new version of the database and created a new table in the database relating to that information. 

### New Admin Reports
Our group added two new reports to the admin dashboard, these reports display the unconfirmed anda confirmed poetry that is currently in the database. On the unconfirmed report the user can mark the author's name and this information will be then sent back to the database which will update both reports with the new information.
