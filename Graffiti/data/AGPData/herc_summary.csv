The name of both the father and the son, Remii Rufi, are named in  a lengthy Herculanean stone inscription CIL X. 1453.They were both given the honors of diligenter for fixing the weights of the grain scale in the city, which is the reason for the long inscription.

EDR151816,10500,,,3,Lagoena,Mention of a flask (?),Flasks,,,,," Written in charcol (carbone), the Text of CIL IV. 10500 reads lagunas, which Della Corte corrects to “lagoenas”. Lagoenae, or lagunae, were narrow-necked bottles, typically used to serve wine (s.v. Oxford Latin Dictionary, 1982). Alternate spellings include lagona, lagena, and lagoena. The word is adapted from the Greek λαγυνος, o. Cf. CIL VI. 1884 and CIL VI. 8866.



Linguistics:
        Lagoena was originally spelled and pronounced with an ū, equivalent to the Greek υ, given evidence from Plautus, who assonates the y (upsilon) in Greek names with the ū in Latin (see Plautus, Mil. 324; Bacch. 129; Anderson, Andrew R. ""The Use of the Oe-Diphthong in Plautus."" Classical Philology 4, no. 3 (1909): 291-300. http://www.jstor.org/stable/262394). Laguna, then, is an almost direct adaption from the Greek λαγυνος. Merely the gender and the stress, which in the Greek receeds to the α, have been corrupted-though λαγυνος was considered feminine by Greek speakers in Thessaly (s.v. Greek-English Lexicon, Liddell and Scott, 1968). Despite the general rule that the œ reduces to the long ū in Latin (Bennett, Charles. The Latin Language. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1907. 9-10), the spelling variant lagoena did not arise until the imperial period (ibid.). 

Appearance and function:
        While not restricted solely to this use, lagunae were most commonly used to carry wine (see CIL VI. 1884 and CIL VI. 8866). They usually had long, narrow necks and big bodies. As Columella states in 10.383-7 “But if you are looking for a gourd of globelike shape which swells out vastly with ample paunch, then choose a seed from the middle of the belly; this will produce capacious fruit fit to make a vessel for Narycian pitch or Attic honey from Hymettus, or a pail handy for water, or a flagon (laguna) of wine.” Furthermore, Columella describes a laguna as having a “wide mouth”. It is unclear whether this applies to all lagunae or a select few (White, K. D. Farm Equipment of the Ancient World. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 161-164).

In Pompeii we see large painted announcements of games, but this is very different because it is on a much smaller and less public scale. It states there will be a match that will have ten pairs of gladiators figthing. It is also important to note that the benefactor of these games appears to be a single person: Numisius Genialis. Advertisements in Pompeii usually announce twenty pairs of gladiators, so by comparison this a much smaller fight but still impressive since it seems that there is only a single benefactor. This graffito shows that there was a gladiatorial presence in the city of Herculaneum. There are also drawings of gladiator helmets which show that there was interest in gladiators in the city. Gladiatorial games were often used to improve public morale and were put on by the political elite to gain more popularity in the city. Evidence of gladiatorial games come from all over the Roman world, so is a common event. 
This graffito also provides an example of the dating system the Romans used. Instead of numbering the days of the month from one to thirty, the Romans named only three days in the month: the kalends, the nonnes, and the ides. The rest of the days were counted backwards from the closest named date. In this case the date that the games will be held is eight days before the kalends of March, meaning eight days before the first of March, which is February 24th."

He is directly addressing  a woman, Primigenia, whom he calls his mistress or lover, who he thought would read his message. He leaves his whereabouts in the near-by city, Puteoli,  the name of his owner, Phoebus, and the name of the man who might know his immediate location within the city. She has all the information needed to locate him, if she so desires. Pompeii attests to at least two other addresses scratched into the wall plaster with similar instructions. 
Some little controversy has been sparked over the identity of the woman mentioned in this graffito, Primigenia. While Primigenia is a common name represented in this region, especially in Pompeii (see CIL IV 3976, 5358, 8175, 8260, 8274, 830?1, 8356, 10241), certain scholars have suggested that they all belong to a single individual. Della Corte argues that she was a traveling actress or a vivacious female intellectual, something of a first century pop-icon from Nuceria (one of the inscriptions mentioning her name leaves an address). However, Verone differs, saying that the sheer number of hands these inscriptions are written in, their locations (the baths, the lupinare), and even the name of the street Primigenia lived on (the Venarian road) suggest that she may have been a high class prostitute.

It is also special because the alphabet is written out in full; while other graffiti include only segments. The entirety of the alphabet is written in uppercase letters with the exception of the last letter, the omega, which is in lowercase. The graffito is written in very clear handwriting, deeply inscribed, and the plaster is well preserved, which means that the graffito is in good condition. This graffito was found inside a wine shop.

Most of the graffiti that we have from Herculaneum are stags, gladiator helmets, or column bases. This one is thought to be a camel, which makes it unique. The animal’s long neck, small head, and feet make it different than other quadrupeds we see. The hooves make it different from a horse, the fact that there is a blanket on it makes it different from the stags, and the neck and head look more similar to a camel than a donkey which is the animal Langner describes it as. A camel would not be a typical animal seen in the Italian peninsula, but artist could have visited Rome and seen one, or even maybe had been in Africa. This is not impossible because Herculaneum did have a lot of boat traffic and Africa is just across the Mediterranean."
