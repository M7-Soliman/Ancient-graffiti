EDR073355,Apollinaris...,Herculaneum,"This graffito names a slave, Apollinaris, who served as doctor to the emperor Titus. Titus was only emperor from 79 to 81, so Apollinaris must have visited Herculaneum only a few months before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. The writing includes flourishes and the first line of text, stating Apollinaris' name and title, is larger than the rest. Other graffiti and painted inscriptions include the warning “cave cacator.“ Was this graffito meant to be a joke? Or perhaps an insult? And do our opinions change when we take into account that Apollinaris is a doctor?",73355
#EDR124973,,Pompeii,"Politics -- CIL 04, 0429
C. Iulium Polybium 
aed. o.v.f. panem bonum fert.

This painted inscription appears on the south side of the Via Nolana, a major road, advertising the candidacy of Gaius Julius Polybius for the office of aedile. The writer of this advertisement uses a common phrase (o.v.f: oro vōs faciatis, “I beg that you elect“) when requesting support for this candidate because he will “provide good bread“ (panem bonum fert). Often, political campaigns provided only the name of the candidate, the sponsor of the ad, and the position for which he is running, but in this case, there is a specific promise offered if elected.",124973

Vesbine copo (:caupo) va(le)

What's the name of the innkeeper? Why did the writer not say Vesbinus?
Vesbinus' friend wrote “copo“ instead of “caupo.“ Do all words sound the same across the United States?

We hear of many other professions at Pompeii in other inscriptions, including the aurifices, lignatores, a lanifricarius, an unctor, a tonsor, a stationarius, and gallinarii. Can you figure out what any of their jobs are?",144784

Primigeniae / Nucer(inae) sal(utem). /
Vellem essem gemma (h)ora(m?) non amplius una(m?), /
Ut tibi signanti oscula missa darem

Written in Pompeii to someone referred to as ‘Nucerian’, the inscription raises interesting questions about travel in the Roman world (Nuceria is one of the closest towns to Pompeii in the region). The poem also references signet rings in the author’s metaphorical wish, offering a convenient avenue for the teacher to address the significance of the signet ring in Roman social, political, and business culture as both a tool and marker of social status. The poem has heavy echoes of a line from Ovid’s Ars Armatoria III 223 (and we see similar riffs on this line in other graffiti in Pompeii). These graffiti could be introduced to students together as a way of prompting a conversation about the degree and type of readership of Ovid’s poems and the impact/value they may have held for the contemporary Roman. Finally, this poem could be linked with other graffiti from Pompeii which makes reference to the name “Primigenia” (with at least one sharing the same connection of location (Nuceria)). The teacher could share multiple of these graffiti with students and promote a discussion revolving around how these different graffiti might tell a story about this ancient Roman woman, and about whether we should or should not imagine them as all referring to the same person.",140143
EDR125001,,Grammar,"Graffiti beginning with the words ”conticuere omnes” or even simply “conticuere” appear a number of times in the city of Pompeii, with a little variety in the spelling of the initial word (occasionally a “q” or “qu” substituted for the “c” in the second half of the word). Those familiar with Vergil's Aeneid may recognize it as the opening line of Book II, when Aeneas and Achates have just been received at the court of Queen Dido in Carthage, and have been reunited with the companions they thought lost at sea (ref Book I). Having been shrouded in mist by Venus (in disguise - or so she thinks - as a hunting maiden) in order that they may enter the city unmolested, the hero and his faithful friend realize that their deeds and those of their fallen Trojan comrades have been immortalized upon the city walls. After the “big reveal“ before the queen herself, Dido implores the newcomers to tell their story to the gathered crowd. Aeneas, understandably, is not immediately willing to do this, as he is still so overcome with emotion after their journey thus far. However, because he is, after all, the hero, he puts on a brave face and allows the retelling.

Book II's opening, complete as “Conticuere omnes intentique ora tenebant,” tells us that the crowd immediately fell silent and turned intent faces to Aeneas. There are a number of possible reasons why this selection is so numerous in graffiti - even more so than Book I.1! Certainly for memorization practice, a key element of Roman education, or even more simply because it is definitely a passage with which most (if not all) Romans would be familiar. This tells us a few things: first, that Vergil's work was widely known enough in the first century to have been not only recognizable but also popular; second, that people were familiar with poetic meter and how it both looked and sounded - one needed not be a poet in order to inscribe it; third, knowing that teachers of the day had no formal schoolroom and instead taught where they could, it is likely that some of these graffiti are “topics of the day“ or “I'll start, you finish“ exercises; and of course, that Romans of the first century AD sincerely valued the themes in the Aeneid, particularly the history of their legendary ancestors (and thereby themselves.) Furthermore, it is interesting to note the placement of these graffiti - mostly in atriums and lupanars. But why put a words as sacred as Vergil's in such un-sacred places? Perhaps because these are two areas where the order, “Conticuere!” might be rather appropriately noted.",
